# Chapter 10 GNSS Augmentation Technique

## What is the GNSS augmentation?  

`enhancement of positioning, vacigation and timing through provision of additional information.`  

## What are the key technologies of satellite based augmentation system?  


## What is the principle of ground-based augmentation network RTK?


## How to design a real-time precise positioning service system?  



## 1. Classification of  arious enhancement techniques  

`Classification criteria: enhancement effect`  

| Ground-Based                                    | G_B                                                   | G_B                                                   | Satellite-based                                      | S_B                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Precision enhancement technique                 | local area difference technology                      | precision positioning technology                      | wide area difference technology                      | wide area precision positioning technology           |
| Integrity enhancement technology                | local different integrity monitoring technology       | system integrity monitoring technoogy                 | wide area difference integrity monitoring technology | wide area difference integrity monitoring technology |
| Continuous and usability enhancement technology | ground-based pseudo-satellite augmentation technology | ground-based pseudo-satellite augmentation technology | space-based satellite augmentation technology        | space-based satellite augmentation technology        |
